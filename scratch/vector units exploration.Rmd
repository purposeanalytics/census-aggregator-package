# Exploring units and aggregation of vectors

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(censusaggregate)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(purrr)
library(cancensus)
library(tidyr)
```

### Look at units and aggregation of vectors, to figure out automagic aggregation

```{r}
vectors <- vectors %>%
  mutate(aggregation_type = str_remove(aggregation, " of.*"))

vectors %>%
  count(units, aggregation_type)
```

#### What is the one "Number" / "Average"?

```{r}
vectors %>%
  filter(
    units == "Number",
    aggregation_type == "Average"
  ) %>%
  glimpse()
```

This one might be hard to do automatically - it probably actually needs to be derived based off of the 2016 and 2011 populations - but I can try!

TODO

#### Are the currency average / median ones all the same vectors (just different aggregations?)

```{r}
currency_vectors <- vectors %>%
  filter(units == "Currency")

currency_vectors <- currency_vectors %>%
  mutate(label_minus_aggregation = str_remove(label, aggregation_type)) %>%
  split(.$aggregation_type)

currency_vectors <- currency_vectors %>%
  map(function(x) {
    x %>%
      pull(label_minus_aggregation) %>%
      sort()
  })

identical(currency_vectors[["Average"]], currency_vectors[["Median"]])
```

Yup!

#### What does ratio mean?

```{r}
vectors %>%
  filter(units == "Ratio") %>%
  select(label)
```

Already all averages

#### Percentage?

```{r}
vectors %>%
  filter(units == "Percentage (0-100)") %>%
  select(label)
```

### Grab data and test aggregating each case

```{r}
cts <- c("5350094.00", "5350093.00")

vectors_to_grab <- vectors %>%
  filter(!(units == "Number" & aggregation_type == "Additive") & is.na(parent_vector)) %>%
  pull(vector)

set.seed(1234)

# For additive, get a few

sample_vectors_to_grab <- vectors %>%
  filter(units == "Number" & aggregation_type == "Additive" & is.na(parent_vector)) %>%
  sample_n(5) %>%
  pull(vector)

vectors_to_grab <- c(vectors_to_grab, sample_vectors_to_grab)

data <- get_census_variables_and_children(regions = list(CT = cts), level = "CT", variables = vectors_to_grab)
```

#### units == "Number", aggregation_type == "Additive"

Get total count (sum of value) for each, then divide by total

Total is from HIGHEST parent vector, NOT from population field
e.g. vector v_CA16_3405 is a total
5350093.00 has population 5652 but value 5405 for the total
5350094.00 has population 4950 but value 4825 for the total

If we use the population, then any children vectors summed will not add up to 100%

```{r}
number_additive_sum <- data %>%
  filter(units == "Number", aggregation_type == "Additive") %>%
  select(vector, label, highest_parent_vector, geo_uid, value) %>%
  arrange(vector, geo_uid) %>%
  group_by(vector, label, highest_parent_vector) %>%
  summarise(
    value = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

number_additive_sum_parents_only <- number_additive_sum %>%
  filter(vector == highest_parent_vector) %>%
  select(highest_parent_vector, parent_value = value)

number_additive_sum %>%
  left_join(number_additive_sum_parents_only, by = "highest_parent_vector") %>%
  mutate(value_proportion = value / parent_value) %>%
  select(-parent_value)
```

#### units == "Number", aggregation_type == "Average"

TODO

```{r}
# data %>%
#   filter(units == "Number", aggregation_type == "Average") %>%
#   select(vector, label, parent_vector, geo_uid, population, value) %>%
#   arrange(vector, geo_uid)
```

#### units == "Currency", aggregation_type == "Average"

Get "total value" (value * population) for each, then sum within vector and divide by total population

Using population because that's what's used to weight the averages to make a "total"

```{r}
data %>%
  filter(units == "Currency", aggregation_type == "Average") %>%
  select(vector, label, geo_uid, population, value) %>%
  arrange(vector, geo_uid) %>%
  mutate(value_total = value * population) %>%
  group_by(vector, label) %>%
  summarise(
    value = sum(value_total) / sum(population),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
```

#### units == "Currency", aggregation_type == "Average"

TODO

#### units == "Ratio", aggregation_type == "Average"

TODO

```{r}
# data %>%
#   filter(units == "Ratio", aggregation_type == "Average") %>%
#   select(vector, label, geo_uid, population, value) %>%
#   arrange(vector, geo_uid)
```

#### units == "Percentage (0-100)", aggregation_type == "Average"

Multiply population by value (/100), then sum and divide by total population in vector (probably more accurately, total population of parent vector?)

```{r}
data %>%
  filter(units == "Percentage (0-100)", aggregation_type == "Average") %>%
  select(vector, label, geo_uid, population, value) %>%
  arrange(vector, geo_uid) %>%
  mutate(value_proportion = value / 100) %>%
  group_by(vector, label) %>%
  summarise(
    value = sum(population * value_proportion) / sum(population) * 100,
    value = round(value, 1),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
```
